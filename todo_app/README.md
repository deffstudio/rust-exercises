## About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## üìù TODO:

These are the features and tasks should be completed as Rust exercises.

- 1. Build structs for pending and done to-do items.
- 2. Build a factory that enables the structs to be built in the module with minimal clean input.
- 3. Build traits that enable a struct to delete, create ,edit, and get to-do items.
- 4. Build a read-and-write-to-file module to store to-do items (we will replace this with a proper database in later chapters).
- 5. Build a config module that can alter the behavior of the application based on the variables in a config file.

### Prerequisites

# Rust Exercises ðŸ¦€

This repository contains my Rust programming exercises, focusing on small projects that help deepen my understanding of the language and its ecosystem. Each project tackles various fundamental and advanced concepts in Rust, ranging from data structures and algorithms to async programming, error handling, and system-level programming.

Feel free to explore the exercises, check out the solutions, and follow along as I progress in mastering Rust.
